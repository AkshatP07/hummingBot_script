Key Features

### üìà Volatility-Aware Spread
- Calculates short-term price volatility using rolling returns.
- Dynamically adjusts the spread multiplier based on observed volatility.
- Wider spreads in high-volatility periods to reduce overtrading and slippage risk.

Trend Detection Logic
- Uses a short-term vs long-term simple moving average (SMA).
- Biases order spreads during uptrends and downtrends to capture momentum.
  - Tighter sell spreads during uptrend.
  - Tighter buy spreads during downtrend.

Inventory Skew Risk Management
- Analyzes current base and quote balance.
- Skews bid/ask spreads to restore balance:
  - If holding too much base: increases sell aggression.
  - If low on base: increases buy aggression.
- Protects from overexposure to either asset.
